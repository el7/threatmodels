<h1>About</h1>

<h1>About</h1>
<p>This site is dedicated to outlining, catagorizing, and explaining threat models
of open source projects that enhance privacy and security. This site does not
accept on faith a project's claims found in promotional materials, instead we
require direct verification via code inspection or other means.</p>
<p>The threat model of an application defines the framework that all security
properties are defined within. Because of this, understanding a threat model
is a prerequisite to understanding an application's security properties.
Making this knowledge more accessible and easy to digest enables users to
decide what application is suitable for their needs.  </p>
