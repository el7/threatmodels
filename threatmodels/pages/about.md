This site is dedicated to outlining, catagorizing, and explaining threat models
of open source projects that enhance privacy and security. This site does not
accept on faith a project's claims found in promotional materials, instead we
require direct verification via code inspection or other means.

The threat model of an application defines the framework that all security
properties are defined within. Because of this, understanding a threat model
is a prerequisite to understanding an application's security properties.
Making this knowledge more accessible and easy to digest enables users to
decide what application is suitable for their needs.
